# CPC 512K RAM Expansion

This is a small project which contains three different implementations of a DK'Tronics compatible 512K Byte RAM expansion card for the Amstrad CPC computers.

  1. A 74 Series based 'Old School' card intended for DIYers for the 6128 and Plus machines
  2. An XC9572/36 CPLD based version of 1 (the original prototype), also for the 6128 and Plus machines
  3. A slightly modified version of 2. with more limited compatibility but supporting the older 464 and 664 machines

All variants have been built and tested on either CPC464 or CPC6128 as appropriate.
