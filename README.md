# Amstrad CPC RAM Expansion

The main event in this GitHub project is a 512K RAM Expansion card for the Amstrad CPC computers from the 1980s.

In fact there are several mini-projects in here and each has its own local README file:

  * [CPC 512K RAM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_ram_expansion/README.md)
  * [CPC 4 ROM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_fourrom/README.md )
  * [CPC 6 ROM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_sixrom/README.md )
  * [CPC 3 slot expansion backplane](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_backplane/README.md "CPC 3 slot expansion backplane")

All of the above projects have been built and tested.

Eagle PCB files and zipped archives suitable for getting boards made are included in the  [Eagle Releases](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/eagle_releases) subdirectory.

Additionally there are several projects in varying stages of development

* [CPC GPIO Card intended for interfacing to RaspberryPi and 6502 peripherals](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_6502/README.md )
* [CPC to Teensy3.5 Microcontroller Card for general use](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/t35_cpld_mfc/README.md )
* [CPC to Teensy3.5 Microcontroller specifically for use as a software ROM box](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/t35_cpld_mfc/README.md )
