# Amstrad CPC RAM Expansion

This is a small project aiming to create two different implementations for a 512KByte RAM expansion card for the Amstrad CPC computers.

The first implementation uses a Xilinx XC9572 CPLD to hold all the logic, producing a simple 2 chip solution with a static RAM.

The second implemention will replace the Xilinx CPLD with 8 or 9 74 series components, to make a simple kit which can be assembled with no need for any microcontroller or FPGA/CPLD programming at all. There will be full set of KiCAD files to produce a PCB for this version.
