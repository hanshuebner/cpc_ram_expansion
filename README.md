# Amstrad CPC RAM Expansion

The main event in this GitHub project is a 1MByte RAM Expansion card for the Amstrad CPC computers from the 1980s.

In fact there are several mini-projects in here and each has its own local README file:

  * [CPC RAM Expansion Cards](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_ram_expansion/README.md)
    * Two cards specifically for the 6128 and 6128 Plus and created entirely with standard 74 series ICs
      * 512KByte version
      * 1MB Version
    * Two Universal RAM cards, compatible with all Amstrad CPC computers providing full 6128 compatibility on a 464
      * 512KByte version
      * 1MB Version
  * [CPC 4 ROM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_fourrom/README.md )
  * [CPC 6 ROM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_sixrom/README.md )
  * [CPC Expansion backplane](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/cpc_backplane/README.md "CPC 3 and 4 slot expansion backplanes")

All of the above projects have been built and tested.

Eagle PCB files and zipped archives suitable for getting boards made are included in the  [Eagle Releases](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/eagle_releases) subdirectory.
