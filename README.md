# Amstrad CPC RAM Expansion

The main event in this GitHub project is a 1MByte RAM Expansion card for the Amstrad CPC computers from the 1980s.

In fact there are several mini-projects in here and each has its own local README file:

  * CPC RAM Expansion Cards
    * Two ['Old School'](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/wiki/'Old-School'-CPC6128-512KB-and-1MB-RAM-Expansion-Cards) cards specifically for the 6128 and 6128 Plus and created entirely with standard 74 series ICs
      * 512KByte version
      * 1MB Version
    * [Two Universal RAM cards](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/wiki/Universal-Amstrad-CPC-RAM-Card), compatible with all Amstrad CPC computers providing full 6128 compatibility on a 464
      * 512KByte version
      * 1MB Version
  * CPC ROM Cards
    * [CPC 4 ROM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/wiki/CPC-Fourrom-Card )
    * [CPC 6 ROM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/wiki/CPC-Sixrom-Card )
    * [CPC 8 ROM Expansion Card](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/wiki/CPC-Eightrom-Card )
  * [CPC Expansion backplanes](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/wiki/CPC-Expansion-Backplane)
    * 3 slot basic backplane
    * 4 slot with box connector feedthrough
    * 4 slot with replicated edge connector, allowing legacy peripherals to be daisy chained

All of the above projects have been built and tested.

Eagle PCB files and zipped archives suitable for getting boards made are included in the  [Eagle Releases](https://github.com/revaldinho/cpc_ram_expansion/blob/master/eagle_releases) subdirectory.
