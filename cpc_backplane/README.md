# CPC Backplane

This project is an expansion backplane for the Amstrad CPC computers, providing 3 Mother MX4 compatible box connectors.

Each connector is provided with a jumper to select whether power will be taken from the CPC's +5V output or an external PSU plugged into 
a three pin header on the expansion board.

The backplane needs a ribbon cable to connect to either the edge connector of a CPC 464/664/6128 or the Centronics connector 
found on the 6128 and 464 plus machines.
