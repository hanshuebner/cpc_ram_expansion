# CPC Backplane

This project is an expansion backplane for the Amstrad CPC computers.

Two versions are available here:

V1.00 provides 3 Mother MX4 compatible box connectors where each connector is provided with a jumper to select whether power will be taken from the CPC's +5V output or an external PSU plugged into a three pin header on the expansion board.

V1.10 provides 4 Mother MX4 compatible box connectors but with a simplified power option. A single jumper selects whether power will be taken from the CPC's +5V output or an external PSU for all slots.

The backplanes need a ribbon cable to connect to either the edge connector of a CPC 464/664/6128 or the Centronics connector 
found on the 6128 and 464 plus machines.
